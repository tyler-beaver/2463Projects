                <p>
                    As a kid one of my favorite games to play was doodle jump. I wanted to see if I could remake the game for this project. Although, this is not a complete version I throughly enjoyed making and understanding the basic concepts that went into the original game. I called my version Jump.

                <p>
                    In Jump the player starts at the home screen that shows the score and highscore. The goal of the player is to see how far they can go where distance is based in points. There are three types of platforms: stationary, moving, and disappear. These were created to make the game more challenging.

                <p>
                    The player can only move left or right the jump distance is already predefined along with the moving speed. However, there is a velocity boost for consecutively hitting platforms which increases the chance of making further jumps. Another object to help gain distance was the spring, which basically launches the player around two times the jump distance in the air. Since the goal is to see who can go the furthest.

                    <p>
                        <li>
                            I would have liked to add an enemy that floats in a spot and if hit causes the player to lose. This would help make the game more challenging.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If an enemy was added then the next concept would be a shooting mechanism. Where the enemy would take a few hits then disappear. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I also would have liked to add another obstacle that could cause the player to lose or maybe a splash back effect. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Lastly, adding some perks along the way would have been an interesting concept. For example, if the user hit an item floating on a platform they can't be hit by the enemy for a few seconds. Another could be a second chance that if the player falls it puts them on the nearest platform.
